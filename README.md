## Learnings:
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; **Blade templates**: Laravel's template engine that will allow developers to embed PHP code within the user's view with neat looking syntax.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; **CRUD**: In this project we learned about resource controllers in Laravel that is essential for the CRUD of the system. 
        Resource controllers includes:

            • index 
            • create
            • store
            • show
            • edit
            • update
            • destroy

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; **Middleware**: This is for user authentication as an intermediary. Middleware checks if user request is authenticated and submits it to backend if authenticated.
